# shop_tkj

I was developed this program with Visual Basic on the VB6 IDE.

I put the visual basic project files in the "vb6 project" directory.
Meanwhile, I use the "project summary" directory to put the source code files and an overview of the application when it is run.

I use this application to process sale and purchase transaction data at the "tkj shop". I put the database file with the name "db1.mdb" in the "vb6 project" directory.

I like to make application programs and ready to learn and work hard as a programmer using the "most popular" category programming language.
I really hope to be given the opportunity to work in your company with the required programming language.
